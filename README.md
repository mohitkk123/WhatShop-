# WhatShop-
A unique blend of online and offline shopping with comparative features.

Introduction :-

When you are sitting at your home on your couch and think of buying something
online, you pick your phone and start searching all the websites for the product you want.
You somehow go to various apps or websites just to compare the prices of the product you
want and end up buying from the site where you were getting the best price. These days,
we dont think about offline shopping,either we donâ€™t consider it or we are way too lazy to
go out and shop. But what if you are getting a better price for your product in a shop in a
local market? Our team came up with an idea of creating an app where a user can compare
the prices of products available on online stores and offline stores.

What is WhatShop?
We came up with a solution of reducing your daily struggles of switching to
plethora of apps and simplified it into one app where you can search any product you want
and can even compare price of the same product between online and offline stores. We
have installed a map on our app where you can fetch your own location and see stores
around you that are selling the products you might need. For instance a lady wants to buy
jewellery she opens WhatShop search for the product and then compares the price on online
and offline store. She found out that store near her is giving better price than online stores.
We have one more feature that is CHAT. A user can chat with the offline store manager
and can learn more about the product.
